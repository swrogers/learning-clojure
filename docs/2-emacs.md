# Emacs - The Ultimate Clojure Editor

If I'm being honestly frank, and it's more like honestly Shane...but whatever....the reason I wanted to pick up a LISP is because I've been wanting to get more in depth into Emacs. Since Emacs is basically a LISP machine, it helps to have some knowledge of LISP in order to use Emacs to its fullest. That, and who knows, maybe learning Clojure can help with future employment prospects, self taught or not.

One thing that I have been doing over the past few months, is building up [my Emacs config](https://gitlab.swrgroups.net/swrogers/dot-emacs-config) from scratch using Org mode. Which is, in and of itself, quite a time consuming beast. For Clojure, I've been using a handful of handy packages.

## Emacs Keyboard References
