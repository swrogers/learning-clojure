# My Clojure Journey

Welcome to my little journey on attempting to learn Clojure!

This is going to be the place where, once the day has come to wind down, I'll recap everything that I've learned during the day. The hope is, that upon doing so it will help to cement things into my long term memory and actually be able to use the language.
