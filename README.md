# My Learning Clojure Journey

This is my journey, as a near 44 year old father of many, to attempt to teach myself Clojure. Why Clojure? That's a great question. I hope that I can answer that, because otherwise I don't know what I'm doing here. I think part of it is that I've tried to get myself back into Emacs....sure, Emacs uses its own LISP language, but honestly once you know one LISP you probably know the most of them. It's also a completely new way of thinking for me, so it's going to be a challenge.

It's kind of a side step for me, actually. I've been trying to teach myself javascript, typescript and some libraries/frameworks (hello, Angular!) and that's been another wrench in the way that I think - when it comes to programming. I can't really say that I've ever actually *been* a programmer, but I can at least read and write some code. I do hope, however, that by learning Clojure I can take that knowledge and use it to - maybe - move into something of a new career. Who knows.

## Resources

- https://www.braveclojure.com/
  
  A Clojure Crash Course! So far, I've really liked the format and writing of this site! It's not dry and keeps things informative and interesting.

- [GitHub - clojure-emacs/cider: The Clojure Interactive Development Environment that Rocks for Emacs](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider)
  
  CIDER - quite possibly one of the coolest development environs that I've used. True, it requires some knowledge of Emacs - but then that's why we are here.

- I'm sure there will be more, and as I find them I'll add them. Mabey. At least that's the idea.
